Been wanting to do this for a very long time. <br>
It started out as an idea to set up The Matrix animation as a video on my FB page. <br>
This exercise required a bit of SCSS as well. <br>

I've uploaded another version of the project, with a simplified JavaScript file. <br>
This time around, we're using simple callback functions and the characters & the setInterval are easier to modify.
